# Cryptography-Algorithms-Collection
This project includes four different programs related to cryptography algorithms, each implementing a distinct decryption technique.

Features:

    Single Key Caesar Cipher: Decrypts messages using a single key Caesar cipher algorithm.
    
    Two Keys Caesar Cipher: Decrypts messages using a two-key Caesar cipher algorithm.
    
    Transposition Cipher: Decrypts messages using a transposition cipher algorithm.
    
    Combined Cipher: Decrypts messages first using a transposition cipher and then a single key Caesar cipher.

Implementation Details:

    Single Key Caesar Cipher: Utilizes a single key to shift letters of the alphabet to decrypt an encoded message.
    
    Two Keys Caesar Cipher: Utilizes two different keys to decrypt an encoded message by alternating the keys for even and odd positions.
    
    Transposition Cipher: Decrypts messages by rearranging characters based on a key that defines the columnar transposition.
    
    Combined Cipher: Decrypts a message first using the transposition cipher and then applies the single key Caesar cipher for final decryption.
